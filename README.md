# Drills

This webapp creates and reads reads aloud customizable workout drills, using Google Chrome's [speech synthesis API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2014/01/Web-apps-that-talk-Introduction-to-the-Speech-Synthesis-API).

The program will construct the drill randomly from the listed activities, read the activities out-loud until the desired round length is up, then start again after the break.

### How to use

You can set:

1. Round length
2. Break length
3. The possible activities to include in the drills
4. The permissible lengths of the activities

There are some pre-defined activities for each category Calisthenics/Cardio/Combo, but you can edit these and create your own routine that the program will read. Don't forget to hydrate.
